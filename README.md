# Classification with Python
## Project Overview
This project is a part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).


## Description
The idea of the project is to practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.


## Dataset
This dataset is about past loans. The [Loan_train.csv] data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted (https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/loan_train.csv).  And [loan_test.csv](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/loan_test.csv).
